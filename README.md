I'd like to say this is where all my writing goes, but that'd be a lie! I keep almost all of it to myself! This is where stuff that's finished to a reasonable level of satisfaction that I don't care or like enough to ever try to get published or take seriously goes.
It's more like the scraps from a plate you give a dog. So. Enjoy!
